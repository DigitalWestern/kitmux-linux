# Kitmux Linux Port Status

**Last inspected:** 2026-07-23

**Implementation state:** Engine and desktop proofs are in progress. Separate
Ubuntu ARM64 headless and XFCE desktop VMs, an ELF `libkitty.so`, a relocatable
299 MB engine runtime, Linux stress tests, and a visible GTK 4 `GtkGLArea`
smoke now exist. No production GTK application or package exists yet.

**Active phase:** Phase 1 — prove headless `libkitty`.

**Next slice:** Finish 1.3 — reproduce the release runtime from clean Ubuntu
and Fedora checkouts, complete the per-library license/SBOM inventory, then
close the release-layout gate. Phase 0.4 shared fixture promotion remains open
and blocks the Rust product model.

## Verified checkout state

Adjacent macOS checkout: `../macos/kitmux/`

Clean reference revision:
`e39381a0ed6c3d1667cb4dfa70e5bc48213b1bc4`
(`style: normalize extracted source endings`)

Reference tag:
`macos-linux-port-baseline-2026-07-23`

Pinned Kitty revision inspected:
`c1d507dbe8cd12830d8b97b0d350d9dc2e4d383f`

The macOS source worktree was clean when tagged. Generated `Kitmux 3.app`,
`Kitmux 4.app`, and `Kitmux 5.app` bundles remain preserved on disk and are
listed only in the checkout's local Git exclude file.

## Planning findings

- `libkitty` exposes a useful C API, but its Makefile, Python-runtime repair,
  render smoke, example host, relocation audit, and packaging are currently
  macOS-specific.
- The C wrapper and Python glue are plausible shared engine code, subject to
  Linux build, PTY, ELF, GL, and bundled-runtime proof.
- The Swift core is most useful first as behavior and fixtures. Some files
  directly depend on Darwin, Combine, CryptoKit, Foundation behavior, or
  macOS paths.
- Rust plus GTK 4 is the first candidate, not a final choice. A disposable GL,
  input, scale, and event-loop spike decides the production stack.
- The first user-facing target is a terminal-only alpha. Browser panes and
  broad distribution support are later decisions.

## Evidence log

### 2026-07-23 — Linux desktop VM and GTK/OpenGL environment proof

- Created `kitmux-linux-desktop`, a separate Ubuntu 26.04 ARM64 Lima VZ VM
  with 4 CPUs, 8 GiB RAM, a 32 GiB disk, video enabled, and only this
  workspace mounted writable.
- Installed XFCE 4.20, TigerVNC/noVNC, GTK 4.22.4, Mesa, Weston, Xwayland, and
  the build toolchain. The local-only noVNC desktop is forwarded to host port
  6080.
- Compiled and launched the project-owned GTK 4 `GtkGLArea` smoke and an XFCE
  terminal. `xdotool` found the visible GTK window and `scrot` captured
  `kitmux-linux/desktop-vm-proof.png`.
- `test-desktop.sh` passed X11, noVNC, GTK compilation, and OpenGL discovery.
  The renderer is Mesa llvmpipe. This is visible X11/software-rendering proof,
  not physical-GPU, GNOME, Wayland, IME, scaling, or package evidence.

### 2026-07-23 — Linux stress and release-layout proof

- Added a Linux-native gate with 16 simultaneous terminal floods, 736,272
  pumped bytes, exit callback/status validation, 24 forced-close cycles,
  direct-child reaping, zombie absence, and exact FD-baseline restoration.
- Full headless gate passed: six C/C++/ELF/engine/session/stress tests plus the
  Rust/C layout check. CTest completed in 6.58 seconds.
- Built a 299 MB release-shaped engine tree with pinned CPython 3.14, Kitty,
  libkitty glue/config/font assets, bundled shared libraries, relative ELF
  runpaths, SHA-256 inventory, and no `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
- The release stress gate passed from both its random staging path and final
  path. It resolved `libpython3.14.so.1.0` inside the bundle and rejected
  embedded paths to this developer checkout.
- The third-party inventory has started but is explicitly incomplete. Clean
  Ubuntu/Fedora reproduction and full licensing/SBOM remain required before
  Slice 1.3 is complete.

### 2026-07-23 — headless Linux engine proof

- Installed Lima 2.2.0 and created `kitmux-linux`, an Ubuntu 26.04 LTS ARM64
  VM using Apple's virtualization driver. Only this Linux workspace is mounted
  writable.
- Locked macOS commit `e39381a` and Kitty commit `c1d507d`; materialized
  libkitty source and verified seven recorded SHA-256 values.
- Built Kitty's `fast_data_types.so` and X11/Wayland backends on Linux. The
  first build exposed the macOS-only GL loader; the durable Linux transform
  now uses `libGL.so.1` plus `glXGetProcAddressARB` and Kitty's non-Apple sRGB
  capability check.
- Built an ARM64 ELF `libkitty.so` linked to CPython 3.14 with `$ORIGIN`
  runpath and a version script exporting only `kitty_*`.
- The locked macOS session suite runs on Linux after two explicit test
  translations: `/private/tmp` becomes `/tmp`, and Apple's exact stock-zsh
  prompt policy is omitted.
- Passed in the Ubuntu VM:

```sh
cmake -S kitmux-linux -B kitmux-linux/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build kitmux-linux/build --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir kitmux-linux/build --output-on-failure
kitmux-linux/scripts/test-rust-header.sh
```

Result: five C/C++/ELF/engine/session tests passed; Rust/C public struct layout
passed. This is headless ARM64 source evidence, not GUI, x86_64, package, or
clean-machine release evidence.

### 2026-07-23 — macOS baseline freeze

- Completed the in-progress `TerminalView` extraction, fixed same-turn
  structural relayout behavior, made GUI smoke failures return a nonzero
  process status, and stabilized control-smoke shell readiness.
- Passed libkitty, Swift smoke, persistence, browser, control, process-close,
  sizing, IME, daily, and stress gates. The source worktree was committed,
  locally preserved app bundles were excluded from status, and the clean
  reference tag was created.

### 2026-07-23 — planning review

- Inspected the original review, the revised plan that replaced it during this
  pass, the macOS handoff and Git status, package manifest, `libkitty`
  build/header/sources, platform imports, tests, and smoke targets.
- Added the agent guide and status ledger.
- No implementation, build, or runtime claim was made.

## Current blockers and limits

- The local desktop VM proves GTK/OpenGL window creation over X11 with
  llvmpipe. Wayland, physical-GPU behavior, IME, clipboard, scaling, and
  desktop packaging remain untested.
- The current VM is ARM64. Tier-1 x86_64 proof still requires CI, a remote
  machine, or a separate emulated/native environment.
- Shared portable fixtures are still provisional. Do not start the Rust model
  or claim snapshot/control parity until macOS and Linux consume the same
  valid and invalid fixture files.
- A relocatable `$ORIGIN` engine tree exists, but Slice 1.3 still requires
  clean Ubuntu/Fedora reproduction and a complete per-library license/SBOM
  inventory.

## Next-agent handoff

Continue
[Slice 1.3 in the implementation plan](LINUX_PORT_PLAN.md#slice-13-build-the-release-shaped-runtime).
Reproduce the current bundle in clean Ubuntu and Fedora environments and
complete its license/SBOM inventory. Do not scaffold production UI until that
gate closes.
